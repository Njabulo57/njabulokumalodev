        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to njabulokumalodev.co.za . We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy outlines how we use local storage on our website.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Local Storage:</h3>
        <p>We use local storage in your web browser to store a flag indicating whether you have visited our website before. This helps us understand and improve user experience.</p>

        <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
        <h3>Tracking User Visits:</h3>
        <p>The local storage item <code>hasVisited</code> is used to determine if you have previously visited our site. This allows us to execute specific functions only if you are a new visitor or coming from a different domain.</p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By using our website, you consent to the use of local storage as described in this Privacy Policy. When you first visit our site, you will see a consent banner informing you of our use of local storage. By clicking "Accept," you agree to our use of local storage.</p>

        <h2>Managing Your Preferences</h2>
        <h3>Opt-Out:</h3>
        <p>If you do not wish for us to store information in local storage, you can choose not to click "Accept" on the consent banner. However, please note that this may affect your user experience on our website.</p>

        <h3>Clearing Local Storage:</h3>
        <p>You can clear your browser's local storage at any time through your browser settings. This will remove the <code>hasVisited</code> flag and any other data stored in local storage by our website.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
